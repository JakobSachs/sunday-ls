# A rewrite/clone of GNU ls

Just a small sunday project ðŸŒ„ , mostly for practice.

# Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/JakobSachs/sunday-ls.git`
- `cd sunday-ls`
- `make`

This will compile the executable to a file called `main`, which i would recommend you rename. 

# TODOS

- [ ] Dynamic resizing of entries array
- [ ] Add colors
- [ ] Add wrapping to the output
- [ ] Add recursive listing 
- [ ] Add list view
- [ ] Add extra sort categories

# Other Notes

I found it currently uses roughly 150% more memory then the original, might do some work to fix this in the future.
