# A rewrite/clone of GNU ls

Just a small sunday project, mostly for practice.

# Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/JakobSachs/sunday-ls.git`
- `cd sunday-ls`
- `make`

This will compile the executable to a file called `main`, which i would recommend you rename. 

# TODOS

-[ ] Add colors
-[ ] Add wrapping to the output
-[ ] Add recursive listing
